# weewx-Setup-RaspberyPi
Short script to intialize and setup a raspberry pi to use the weewx weather station library.
Will setup a raspberry pi after a fress install of ubuntu or a debian based ISO ie: raspbian.

##Use
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/JosephMeli/weewx-Setup-RaspberyPi.git \
  cd weewx-Setup-RaspberryPi \
  chmod +x setpi.sh \
  ./setpi.sh
```
Please note this is a rasperryPi and it will take a very long time because of the computing power they have compared to a normal computer.

###Next
Need to setup Ngnix to host the the html page for the weewx dashboard

look to edit ```/etc/ngnix/site-available/default ``` then add the following to file in the spot for location:
```
# file looks simlar to this 
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # SSL configuration
        #
        # listen 443 ssl default_server;
        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
	#
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        root /var/www/html;
         # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	      server_name _;

       # location /mesowx/web {
        
        ***********THIS IS WHAT YOU CHANGE  the location tage to be*************************************************************
      >  location /weewx {
      >    	alias /home/weewx/public_html;
       
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
		            alias /home/mesowx/public_html;
	              try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
